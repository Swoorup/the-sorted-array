# Ts-node-vitest-boilerplate

An empty project to start a node library with vite and vitest âš¡

# For Libraries
This is intended for typescript libraries or server-side code, not frontend apps. If you are looking to build a frontend app, I'd look here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/

```
git clone https://github.com/antoineMoPa/ts-node-vitest-boilerplate.git

```
mkdir my-epic-new-project-name
cd my-epic-new-project-name
npx degit https://github.com/antoineMoPa/ts-node-vitest-boilerplate.git
```
